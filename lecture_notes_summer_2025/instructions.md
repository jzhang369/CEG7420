# **Ghidra Scripting: Working with Instructions**

## **Why Instructions Matter?**

In Ghidra, **instructions** represent the low-level operations executed by a processor and are fundamental to binary analysis. While binaries contain raw machine code, Ghidra disassembles this code into *human-readable* **assembly instructions**, enabling analysts to understand program behavior at the instruction level.

In this section, the term *instructions* specifically refers to assembly instructions. Later, we will introduce intermediate representations, such as **Pcode**, which can also be considered a form of instruction but at a higher abstraction level.

Ghidra provides APIs for interacting with instructions programmatically, supporting a variety of tasks such as:

- Iterating over instructions
- Extracting mnemonics and operands
- Identifying relationships with other objects (e.g.,through `reference`). 

The `Instruction` class in Ghidra offers rich methods for retrieving details of an instruction, including its mnemonic, operands, and references to memory locations or registers.



## **Where to Find More Information?**

For more detailed information on programming with instructions in Ghidra, refer to the official Ghidra API documentation. The relevant information can be found in your Ghidra installation at: 

docs/GhidraAPI_javadoc/api/ghidra/program/model/listing/Instruction.html


## **Working With Instructions**

### **Retrieving One Instruction Object in Ghidra**

## **Retrieving Instructions Using `FlatProgramAPI`**

Letâ€™s begin with the `FlatProgramAPI`, which provides several convenient methods to retrieve `Instruction` objects:

- `getFirstInstruction()` / `getLastInstruction()`  
Retrieve the first or last instruction in the entire program.

- `getFirstInstruction(Function function)`  
  Returns the first instruction within a specified function.

- `getInstructionAt(Address address)`  
  Retrieves the instruction located exactly at the given address, if one exists.

- `getInstructionContaining(Address address)`  
  Returns the instruction that contains the specified address (useful for instructions spanning multiple bytes).

- `getInstructionAfter(Address address)` / `getInstructionAfter(Instruction instruction)`  
  Returns the instruction that follows the given address or instruction.

- `getInstructionBefore(Address address)` / `getInstructionBefore(Instruction instruction)`  
  Returns the instruction that precedes the given address or instruction.


```python
# get the first instruction and the last instruction in this binary.
firstInstruction = getFirstInstruction()
print(firstInstruction)

lastInstruction = getLastInstruction()
print(lastInstruction)
```

```python
# enumerate through all functions in this binary, and for each function print out its first instruction. 
fm = currentProgram.getFunctionManager()
allFuncs = fm.getFunctions(True)
for f in allFuncs:
	firstInstruction = getFirstInstruction(f)
 	print("The first instruction of {} function is {}".format(f, firstInstruction))
```

```python
# ask the user to offer an address and then attempt to get the instruction at that address. This address is for the address of the very first byte of the instruction. 
addr = askAddress("Lecture for Instructions", "Please give me an address!")
myInstruction = getInstructionAt(addr)
if myInstruction:
	print(myInstruction)
else:
	print("no instruction found at the address of {}.".format(addr))
```
```python
# ask the user to offer an address and then attempt to get the instruction that contains address. Note: an instruction might be composed of multiple bytes.  
addr = askAddress("Lecture for Instructions", "Please give me an address!")
myInstruction = getInstructionContaining(addr)
if myInstruction:
	print(myInstruction)
else:
	print("no instruction that contains the address of {}.".format(addr))
```

### **Enumerating all Instructions in a Binary**

**Option 1:** You can use `getInstructionAfter()` and `getInstructionBefore()` to enumerate all instructions inside a binary. 

```python
# Get the first instruction and then enumerate the one after this, and keep doing that. 
myInstruction = getFirstInstruction()
while myInstruction:
    print(myInstruction)
    myInstruction = getInstructionAfter(myInstruction)
```

**Option 2:** Get the `listing` object, and use the `listing`'s methods. 

```python
# getInstructions returns an iterator of instructions inside this binary
myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(True)
for inst in instructionIterator:
    print(inst)
```


### **Enumerating all Instructions in a Function**

**Option 1:** Enumerate all instructions starting from the first instruction of this function, and check whether this instruction's address is inside the body of this function. 

```python
# display all instructions inside the function indicated by your cursor. 
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() # this is the body of the function, it is an AddressSetView, a set of addresses. 
	print(myFunc)
	myInstruction = getFirstInstruction(myFunc)
	while myInstruction and fbody.contains(myInstruction.getAddress()): # verify whether the address of this instruction is inside the set of addresses for this function. 
		print("address: {}, instruction: {}".format(myInstruction.getAddress(), myInstruction))
		myInstruction = getInstructionAfter(myInstruction)
else:
	print("No function found at {}.".format(currentAddress))
```


**Option 2:** Using `getInstructions(AddressSetView addrSet, boolean forward)` of the `listing` object. 

```python
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True) # myListing.getInstructions(AddressSetView, Boolean) will return instructions that are inside this set of addresses
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		print(inst)
```

### **Retrieving Useful Information from an Instruction Object**

Potentially useful information for an instruction:
 
When working with an `Instruction` object in Ghidra, you can extract some properties that may be useful for analysis or scripting:

+ mnemonic: `getMnemonicString()`
  + type
+ operands: `getInputObjects()`
  + value
  + type
+ address: `getAddress()`, `getMinAddress()`, and `getMaxAddress()`
+ size:	`getLength()`
+ Fall-Through: the fall-through of an instruction refers to the next sequential instruction in memory that would be executed if there is no explicit change in control flow. 
  + For most linear instructions (`mov`, `add`, and etc.), execution naturally proceeds to the next instruction.
  + For branching instructions, such as `JMP`, `CALL`, and `RET`, execution may deviate from the sequential flows. 

```python
# This example is to count the occurence for each mnemonic string showing up in this body of the current function. 
myDict = {}

myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		mnemonic = inst.getMnemonicString()
		if mnemonic in myDict:
			myDict[mnemonic] = myDict[mnemonic] + 1
		else:
			myDict[mnemonic] = 1

print(myDict)
```



```python
# get address, min address, max address, and the length of an instruction
# the address is the same to the min address
# the length of an instruction is the number of bytes for this instruction
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		operands = inst.getInputObjects()
		print(inst)
		print("address: {}, min_address: {}, max_address: {}, size: {}".format(inst.getAddress(), inst.getMinAddress(), inst.getMaxAddress(), inst.getLength()))
```


```python
# get the fallthrough instructions and non-fallthrough/target instructions for J, CALL, and RET instructions.
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		if inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("J") or inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("CALL") or inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("RET"):
			print("{}\t{}".format(inst.getAddress(), inst))
			addrFallThrough = inst.getFallThrough()
			if addrFallThrough:
				fallThroughtInst = getInstructionAt(addrFallThrough)
				print("		fallthrough to: {}\t{}".format(addrFallThrough, fallThroughtInst))
			addrOtherThanFallThrough = inst.getFlows()
			for one in addrOtherThanFallThrough:
				notFallThroughtInst = getInstructionAt(one)
				print("		notfallthrough/target to: {}\t{}".format(one, notFallThroughtInst))

```

### **Application 1: Enumerate All Callees of the Current Function**

**Option 1:** Parse each instruction, get operands, and find the address in the operand.

```python
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		if inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("CALL"):
			# get the operand, and the operand will be the entry address of the callee
			# and then you can use getFunctionAt(addr) to retrieve the callee information. 
			calleeAddr = inst.getOpObjects(0)[0]
			callee = getFunctionAt(calleeAddr)
			print("{} at {} calls {}.".format(myFunc, inst.getAddress(), callee))
```



**Option 2:** Using *flows* to get the address of the callee.

```python
myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	fbody = myFunc.getBody() #fbody is an object of AddressSetView
	print(myFunc)
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(fbody, True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		if inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("CALL"):
			addrOtherThanFallThrough = inst.getFlows() # this gives the target of the instruction
			for one in addrOtherThanFallThrough:
				callee = getFunctionAt(one)
				print("		callee: {}".format(callee))


```

### **Application 2: Enumerate All Callers of the Current Function**

**Option 1**: 
+ Enumerate all instructions, and identify `CALL` instructions, 
+ For a `CALL` instruction, check whehter its operand matches with the address of the current function. 
  + If so, this instruction is a `CALL` instruction to the current function, and the function that contains that instruction will be a caller of the current instruction. 
  + Get the function that contains the address of that instruction. 

```python
callers = set()

myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	# getInstructions returns an iterator of instructions inside this binary
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		if inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("CALL"):
			calleeAddr = inst.getOpObjects(0)[0]
			if myFunc.getEntryPoint() == calleeAddr:
				callerFunc = getFunctionContaining(inst.getAddress())
				print("Caller: {} at {} calls {}".format(callerFunc, inst.getAddress(), myFunc))
				callers.add(callerFunc)

print(callers)
```


**Option 2**: Use `getFlows()` instead of `getOpObjects(0)[0]`, which makes the code more readable. 

```python
callers = set()

myFunc = getFunctionContaining(currentAddress)
if myFunc:
	# getInstructions returns an iterator of instructions inside this binary
	myListing = currentProgram.getListing()
	instructionIterator = myListing.getInstructions(True)
	for inst in instructionIterator:
		if inst.getMnemonicString().startswith("CALL"):
			for calleeAddr in inst.getFlows():
				if myFunc.getEntryPoint() == calleeAddr:
					callerFunc = getFunctionContaining(inst.getAddress())
					print("Caller: {} at {} calls {}".format(callerFunc, inst.getAddress(), myFunc))
					callers.add(callerFunc)

print(callers)
```
